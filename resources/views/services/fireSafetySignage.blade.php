                        <h2>What is Fire Safety Signage?</h2>
                        
                        <p>Fire safety signage comprises a range of signs and symbols that provide vital information about fire safety procedures, emergency exits, fire-fighting equipment, and evacuation routes.

                        <p>Protects Property: By facilitating a quick and orderly evacuation, fire safety signage helps protect property and minimize damage. Clear instructions on using fire-fighting equipment can also help control small fires before they spread.</p>
                        
                        <p>Boosts Confidence: Having clear and well-placed fire safety signage boosts the confidence of occupants, knowing that the building is prepared for emergencies and that their safety is a priority.</p>
